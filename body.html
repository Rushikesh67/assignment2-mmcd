<span class="auto-style1">Mechanical engineering is the study, design, 
development, construction, and testing of mechanical and thermal sensors and 
devices, including tools, engines, and machines. Mechanical engineering careers 
center on creating technologies to meet a wide range of human needs.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Mechanical engineering subjects include automobile 
engineering, manufacturing engineering, power plant engineering, thermal 
engineering, and mechatronics engineering, which is a combination of electrical, 
computer, and mechanical engineering.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">What do mechanical engineers do? Mechanical engineers 
generally work in offices but are sometimes called to the field, visiting 
worksites when a problem or piece of equipment needs their personal attention, 
and to oversee elements of construction. Mechanical engineers work mostly in 
engineering services, research and development, and manufacturing.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">Mechanical engineering has its roots in the industrial 
revolution with the advent of the steam engine, automated manufacturing, and the 
demands of railroad transportation requiring increasingly innovative and 
sophisticated engineering solutions.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">EdX offers online mechanical engineering courses for 
free from top engineering schools. Whether you're interested in learning more 
about the history of mechanical engineering, or you want to pursue a mechanical 
engineering degree, there’s an opportunity for you to go beyond perusing 
mechanical engineering books and learn online.</span></p>
